abstract = {M2AlC phases, where M is a transition metal, are layered ternary compounds that possess unusual properties. In this paper, we have calculated the elastic properties of M2AlC, with M=Ti, V, Cr, Nb and Ta, by means of ab initio total energy calculations using the projector augmented-wave method. We have derived the bulk and shear moduli, Young's moduli and Poisson's ratio for ideal polycrystalline M2AlC aggregates. We have estimated the elastic modulus of Cr2AlC with 357.7 GPa while the values of all other phases are in the range 309±10 GPa. We suggest that this can be understood based on the calculated bond energies for the M–C bonds. Furthermore, our results indicate a profound elastic anisotropy of M2AlC even compared to materials with a well-established anisotropic character such as $\alpha$-alumina. Finally, we have estimated the Debye temperatures of M2AlC from the average sound velocity.},

@article{Perez2007,
abstract = {T he backbone of scientific computing is mostly a collection of high-perfor-mance code written in Fortran, C, and C++ that typically runs in batch mode on large systems, clusters, and supercomputers. However, over the past decade, high-level environ-ments that integrate easy-to-use interpreted lan-guages, comprehensive numerical libraries, and visualization facilities have become extremely popu-lar in this field. As hardware becomes faster, the crit-ical bottleneck in scientific computing isn't always the computer's processing time; the scientist's time is also a consideration. For this reason, systems that allow rapid algorithmic exploration, data analysis, and vi-sualization have become a staple of daily scientific work. The Interactive Data Language (IDL) and Matlab (for numerical work), and Mathematica and Maple (for work that includes symbolic manipula-tion) are well-known commercial environments of this kind. GNU Data Language, Octave, Maxima and Sage provide their open source counterparts. All these systems offer an interactive command line in which code can be run immediately, without having to go through the traditional edit/com-pile/execute cycle. This flexible style matches well the spirit of computing in a scientific context, in which determining what computations must be performed next often requires significant work. An interactive environment lets scientists look at data, test new ideas, combine algorithmic approaches, and evaluate their outcome directly. This process might lead to a final result, or it might clarify how they need to build a more static, large-scale pro-duction code. As this article shows, Python (www.python.org) is an excellent tool for such a workflow. 1 The IPython project (http://ipython.scipy.org) aims to not only provide a greatly enhanced Python shell but also facilities for interactive distributed and par-allel computing, as well as a comprehensive set of tools for building special-purpose interactive envi-ronments for scientific computing.},

abstract = {In comparing a material's resistance to distort under mechanical load rather than to alter in volume, Poisson's ratio offers the fundamental metric by which to compare the performance of any material when strained elastically. The numerical limits are set by (1/2) and -1, between which all stable isotropic materials are found. With new experiments, computational methods and routes to materials synthesis, we assess what Poisson's ratio means in the contemporary understanding of the mechanical characteristics of modern materials. Central to these recent advances, we emphasize the significance of relationships outside the elastic limit between Poisson's ratio and densification, connectivity, ductility and the toughness of solids; and their association with the dynamic properties of the liquids from which they were condensed and into which they melt.},

abstract = {Effects of aluminum and silicon on the twin boundary energy (TBE) of titanium carbide (TiC) have been investigated using transmission electron microscopy and first-principles calculations. The results demonstrate that Al is more effective relative to Si to reduce the twin boundary energy of TiC. By electronic structure analysis, the high TBE of pure TiC can be attributed to the energy penalty accompanying the formation of trigonal prismatic coordination of Ti atoms at twin boundaries. For the Si/Al doped TiC, the lower TBE's are partly due to the absence of the energy penalty accompanying the formation of trigonal prismatic coordination of Si/Al atoms, and are partly due to the stabilizing effect via the formation of $\pi$ bonding between carbon neighbors of Si/Al atoms. The $\pi$ bonding between carbon neighbors of Al is stronger than that of Si, providing an explanation for the larger twin-stabilizing effect of Al. {\textcopyright} 2003 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {Based on the idea that the hardness of covalent crystal is intrinsic and equivalent to the sum of the resistance to the indenter of each bond per unit area, a semiempirical method for the evaluation of hardness of multicomponent crystals is presented. Applied to beta-BC2N crystal, the predicted value of hardness is in good agreement with the experimental value. It is found that bond density or electronic density, bond length, and degree of covalent bonding are three determinative factors for the hardness of a polar covalent crystal. Our method offers the advantage of applicability to a broad class of materials and initializes a link between macroscopic property and electronic structure from first principles calculation.},

abstract = {Recently, autonomous crack healing has been reported for Ti2AlC and Ti3AlC2 of the Mn+1AXn (MAX) phase ceramics. The desirable healing behaviour is due to the formation of a stable, well-adhering oxide with a high relative volume expansion and having mechanical properties close to those of the matrix. The present analysis aims to predict the occurrence of similar autonomous high-temperature crack-healing behaviour in other MAX phase materials on the basis of postulated primary and secondary criteria analysing their reported thermodynamic, thermo-kinetic and mechanical properties. The analysis correctly identified Ti2AlC and Ti3AlC2 as suitable MAX phase variants for autonomous high-temperature crack healing. Also other Al-containing MAX phases seem promising, of which Ta2AlC and V2AlC were identified as worth a detailed investigation of their crack-healing behaviour. Of the Si-containing MAX phase compounds Ti3SiC2 met the criteria for autonomous high-temperature crack healing.},
