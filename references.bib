@article{Christian2002,
abstract = {The properties of linear defects in crystals (dislocation lines) and of planar defects (stacking faults) are important in almost every branch of solid state physics. This article is intended to give a comprehensive introduction to dislocation theory for the physicist who is not a specialist in crystal plasticity. It begins with a survey of the established theory relating to the geometrical and topological properties of dislocations, the elastic theory of dislocations in a continuum, the atomistic or core properties of dislocations, and the dynamics of moving dislocations. General methods for finding the elastic field of an arbitrary dislocation loop are outlined, and the results of some recent calculations using anisotropic elasticity are summarized. These include the prediction, partially confirmed by experiment, that dislocations in certain ranges of orientation may have negative line tension. The current importance of atomistic calculations of core structure and related problems is emphasized, and the methods available for these calculations are discussed.},

@article{Lu2000peierls,
abstract = {We re-examine two important issues within the Peierls-Nabarro model, which are critical in obtaining accurate values for the Peierls stress. The first is related to the sampling scheme (double versus single counting) of the misfit energy across the glide plane and the second is the effect of atomic relaxation on the Peierls stress. We argue that the double-counting scheme is physically more appropriate. An analytical formula is derived for the Peierls stress of dislocations in alternating lattices. The atomic relaxation is shown to play an important role on the Peierls stress for narrow dislocations.},

abstract = {One of the fundamental difficulties in engineering design is the multiplicity of local solutions.-This has triggered great efforts to develop global search algorithms. Globality, however, often has a prohibitively high numerical cost for real problems. A fixed cost local search, which sequentially becomes global is developed. Globalization is achieved by probabilistic restart. A spatial probability of starting a local search is built based on past searches. An improved Nelder-Mead algorithm makes the local optimizer. It accounts for variable bounds. It is additionally made more robust by reinitializing degenerated Simplexes. The resulting method, called Globalized Bounded Nelder-Mead (GBNM) algorithm, is particularly adapted to tackle multimodal, discontinuous optimization problems, for which it is uncertain that a global optimization can be afforded. Different strategies for restarting the local search are discussed. Numerical experiments are given on analytical test functions and composite laminate design problems. The GBNM method compares favorably to an evolutionary algorithm, both in terms of numerical cost and accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2004 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A rclaxation-type calculation of the structure of the dislocation core has been made for the 4<111> screw dislocation in b.c.c. crystals, using a variety of central-force potentials. Two stable configurations were found, corre- sponding to the centre of the dislocation being along either the left-hand or the right-hand type of three-fold screw axis in the crystal. These two configurations differed only in the very centre. For both configurations and for all potentials, the core structure possessed three-fold symmetry, the largest displacements being in the directions in which displacements on (211) type planes were in the twinning sense. The structure can bc described by a combination of large displacements on {IlO}type planes, plus ' stacking faults ', 1-2b wide on {211) type planes in the twinning sense only. An investigation of the effect of boundary conditions showed that any crrors caused by incomplete relaxation were negligible, and that changing the initial dislocation position or the position of the boundaries did not affect tho final core structure. Four potentials were used, similar in form but having a five-fold variation in the depth of the minimum. The core structure was similar for all of these : the only changes were in the relative magnitude of the displacements and in the ' stacking fault ' width which varied between, approximately, 1.221and 2b. This core structure therefore appears to be general for b.c.c. crystals, and the implications of these results on the movement of dislocations are briefly discussed.}},

@article{Weinberger2013,
abstract = {It is well knownthat screwdislocation motion dominates the plastic deformation in body-centered-cubicmetals at low temperatures. The nature of the nonplanar structure of screw dislocations gives rise to high lattice friction, which results in strong temperature and strain rate dependence of plastic flow. Thus the nature of the Peierls potential, which is responsible for the high lattice resistance, is an important physical property of the material. However, current empirical potentials give a complicated picture of the Peierls potential. Here, we investigate the nature of the Peierls potential using density functional theory in the bcc transition metals. The results show that the shape of the Peierls potential is sinusoidal for everymaterial investigated. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of the potential scales strongly with the energy per unit length of the screw dislocation in the material.},

abstract = {Despite vast differences in their other properties, the responses of Ti3SiC2 and ice to stress are quite similar in that they are quite strain-rate sensitive; if loaded rapidly, both are brittle, but if loaded slowly they are quite plastic. This stems from the fact that both are plastically very anisotropic; deformation occurs overwhelmingly, if not exclusively, by slip along basal planes. In both cases, stress concentrations and the rate at which they are relaxed dictate the nature of the mechanical response. In the brittle regime, microcracks and their linkage play a dominant role in both cases.},

abstract = {In comparing a material's resistance to distort under mechanical load rather than to alter in volume, Poisson's ratio offers the fundamental metric by which to compare the performance of any material when strained elastically. The numerical limits are set by (1/2) and -1, between which all stable isotropic materials are found. With new experiments, computational methods and routes to materials synthesis, we assess what Poisson's ratio means in the contemporary understanding of the mechanical characteristics of modern materials. Central to these recent advances, we emphasize the significance of relationships outside the elastic limit between Poisson's ratio and densification, connectivity, ductility and the toughness of solids; and their association with the dynamic properties of the liquids from which they were condensed and into which they melt.},

@article{Hoagland1976,
abstract = {Dislocation core behaviour was studied by determining the equilibrium arrangement of ions surrounding an $\alpha$/2< 110>(110) edge dislocation in potassium chloride. A computer simulation method was used to solve the equations of motion of the ions interacting through a Coulombic potential, with a Born-Mayer repulsive contribution, between nearest neighbours. Two flexible boundary schemes were employed and their application and importance to the results are described. The observed difference between the Volterra description of the ion positions and the calculated equilibrium position constitutes the core field. This core field was examined in detail but its most important feature is a lattice expansion of about 0{\textperiodcentered}5 b2 per unit dislocation length. Shear stresses were also applied to the models using flexible boundary conditions with results indicating a Peierls stress in the range of 12{\textperiodcentered}7 to 32{\textperiodcentered}4 MPa which is in reasonable agreement with experiment. The ease of moving the dislocation was quite sensitive to boundary conditions. Some implication of possible core field effects, including interaction with other defects and coupling with the full stress tensor to influence the Peierls stress, are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

abstract = {Dislocations are topological line defects in three-dimensional crystals. Same-sign dislocations repel according to Frank's rule |b1 + b2|2 > |b1|2 + |b2|2. This rule is broken for dislocations in van der Waals (vdW) layers, which possess crystallographic Burgers vector as ordinary dislocations but feature "surface ripples" due to the ease of bending and weak vdW adhesion of the atomic layers. We term these line defects "ripplocations" in accordance to their dual "surface ripple" and "crystallographic dislocation" characters. Unlike conventional ripples on noncrystalline (vacuum, amorphous, or fluid) substrates, ripplocations tend to be very straight, narrow, and crystallographically oriented. The self-energy of surface ripplocations scales sublinearly with |b|, indicating that same-sign ripplocations attract and tend to merge, opposite to conventional dislocations. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we directly observed ripplocation generation and motion when few-layer MoS2 films were lithiated or mechanically processed. Being a new subclass of elementary defects, ripplocations are expected to be important in the processing and defect engineering of vdW layers.},

Current topics discussed include elasticity and ideal strength, dislocation structure and mobility, grain boundaries, point defects, and rapid resolidification, as well as noteworthy examples of research that directly impacts the issue of linking of length and/or time scales, as required in multiscale materials modeling. The work reviewed has been inspired by the recent international Workshop on Multiscale Modeling of Materials Strength and Failure held in October 2001 at Bodega Bay, California.},
