@article{Wright2009,
abstract = {Typesetting values with units requires care to ensure that the combined mathematical meaning of the value plus unit combination is clear. In par- ticular, the SI units system lays down a consistent set of units with rules on how these are to be used. However, different countries and publishers have differing conventions on the exact appearance of numbers (and units). The siunitx provides a set of tools for authors to typeset numbers and units in a consistent way. The package has an extended set of configuration options which make it possible to follow varying typographic conventions with the same input syntax. The package includes automated processing of numbers and units, and the ability to control tabular alignment of numbers. A number of LaTeX packages have been developed in the past for format- ting units: SIunits, SIstyle, unitsdef, units, fancyunits and fancynum. Support for users of all of these packages is available as emulation modules in siunitx. In addition, siunitx can carry out many of the functions of the dcolumn, rccol and numprint packages.},

abstract = {Dislocation motion on different slip systems was produced in PbS by electron-beam-induced thermal stresses. Besides the well known primary {100} and secondary {110} slip planes, extended slip on {111} was observed. The different slip systems were identified by slip trace and Burgers vector analyses. In addition, cross-slip on low and higher indexed planes was observed as well as dislocation annihilation contributing to dynamical recovery. The activation of the {111}???110??? slip system is discussed in terms of Peierls and dislocation solute interactions. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {Dislocations are topological line defects in three-dimensional crystals. Same-sign dislocations repel according to Frank's rule |b1 + b2|2 > |b1|2 + |b2|2. This rule is broken for dislocations in van der Waals (vdW) layers, which possess crystallographic Burgers vector as ordinary dislocations but feature "surface ripples" due to the ease of bending and weak vdW adhesion of the atomic layers. We term these line defects "ripplocations" in accordance to their dual "surface ripple" and "crystallographic dislocation" characters. Unlike conventional ripples on noncrystalline (vacuum, amorphous, or fluid) substrates, ripplocations tend to be very straight, narrow, and crystallographically oriented. The self-energy of surface ripplocations scales sublinearly with |b|, indicating that same-sign ripplocations attract and tend to merge, opposite to conventional dislocations. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we directly observed ripplocation generation and motion when few-layer MoS2 films were lithiated or mechanically processed. Being a new subclass of elementary defects, ripplocations are expected to be important in the processing and defect engineering of vdW layers.},

Since 1960 iridium has been the subject of much research, but this has not lead to an understanding of its inclination to brittle fracture under load, although the problem of working iridium has been successfully solved. Grain boundary brittleness during mechanical treatment is the main problem with iridium, and is a continuing and important topic for academic discussion about iridium. Discussion of this problem, begun forty years ago, is continued here.},
