\begin{abstract}

Many materials with complex crystal structures have attractive properties including high melting points, high specific strength, low creep rates, good environmental stability among others. However their use as structural materials is limited by the toughness which is generally low. This lack of toughness is due to the difficulty of dislocation motion.

In complex crystals dislocation flow is usually limited not by microstructural features but by the inherent lattice resistance of the structure.
