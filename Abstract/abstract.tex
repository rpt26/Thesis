Many materials with complex crystal structures have attractive properties including high melting points, high specific strength, low creep rates, good environmental stability among others. However their use as structural materials is limited by the toughness which is generally low, and this low toughness is often the lifetime limiting property of those complex materials that are used in other applications, such as coatings which often fail by cracking. This lack of toughness is due to the difficulty of dislocation motion.

In complex crystals dislocation flow is usually limited not by microstructural features but by the inherent lattice resistance of the structure, but there are some complex structures that show anamalously low flow stresses. The MAX phases, which are ternary carbides or nitrides are one such group of phases.
